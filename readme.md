# ASIC business names dataset

ASIC maintains a list of business names registered in Australia. However, they replace the dataset with every update, making it difficult to look at trends over time. This is because deregistered business names are only kept in the data for 12 months after deregistration, so the data is a snapshot of current business names, plus some deregistered business names, but not all historical business names.

For our reporting on tobacco and vape shops, I requested a dataset with all the deregistered business names since 2010. This can be combined with the current dataset to get a complete list of all business names since 2010.

This repo will also scrape the ASIC business names dataset to ensure a current snapshot of deregistered business names will be archived for future use for the same purposes, allowing time series analysis of the business name register.

You can download the original deregistered names dataset I requested from ASIC [here](https://github.com/nickjevershed/asic_business_names_register/raw/refs/heads/main/historical_data/6375%20-%20Historical%20CNCL%20Business%20Names%20Dataset.zip)

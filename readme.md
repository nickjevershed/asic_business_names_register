# ASIC business names dataset

ASIC maintains a list of business names registered in Australia. However, they replace the dataset with every update, making it difficult to look at trends over time. This is because deregistered business names are only kept in the data for 12 months after deregistration. 

For our reporting on tobacco and vape shops, I requested a dataset with all the deregistered business names since 2010. This can be combined with the current dataset to get a complete list of all business names since 2010.
